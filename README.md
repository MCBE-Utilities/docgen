# Docgen
Docgen is a CLI documentation generator used on most big MCBE-Utilities Typescript projects.

It works by recursively iterating through build distribution declarations and pulling out key information.

Docgen does not actually generate an entire website at the moment and only generates the needed MDX files for our [docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site. It is also currently hardcoded to generate our preferred style of displaying documentation.

These are both things we plan to change in the future to make this tool more versatile to use across other projects we create.
